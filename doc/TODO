SSA revamp:

- update abstract state impl
  - define "context": loop-PC stack
  - for SSA values (including blockparams), abstract state for is
    *flow-insensitive* but *context-sensitive* (for a given loop-PC
     stack)
  - for the memory overlay and globals, abstract state is
    flow-sensitive as well as context-sensitive

- rework const-evaluator
  - toplevel workqueue of (bb, context)
