- Come up with a better scheme than max-SSA for SSA reconstruction across
  contexts
  - context-update (not push) only on backedge? then look up in parent
    context? what constraints do we need to check for this to work? do
    we need to designate a "context-switch header" and enforce
    structure on the push/update/pop?

- Memory-renaming: "alias taint" scheme
