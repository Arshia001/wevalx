- Memory-renaming: "alias taint" scheme

- Limits on size of created specialization and/or on number of specializations
  - perhaps in SM too: out-of-line more aggressively from interpreter loop
  - make sure we're merging appropriate bailout paths (in SM)

- Functionality to remove specialization request from queue when GC'd or moved
